        music, art concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for
        beauty of form or emotional expression, usually according to cultural
        standards of rhythm, melody, and, in most Western music, harmony. Both
        the simple folk song and the complex electronic composition belong to
        the same activity, music. Both are humanly engineered; both are
        conceptual and auditory, and these factors have been present in music of
        all styles and in all periods of history, throughout the world. Music is
        an art that, in one guise or another, permeates every human society.
        Modern music is heard in a bewildering profusion of styles, many of them
        contemporary, others engendered in past eras. Music is a protean art; it
        lends itself easily to alliances with words, as in song, and with
        physical movement, as in dance. Throughout history, music has been an
        important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with the
        capacity to reflect and influence human emotion. Popular culture has
        consistently exploited these possibilities, most conspicuously today by
        means of radio, film, television, musical theatre, and the Internet. The
        implications of the uses of music in psychotherapy, geriatrics, and
        advertising testify to a faith in its power to affect human behaviour.
        Publications and recordings have effectively internationalized music in
        its most significant, as well as its most trivial, manifestations.
        Beyond all this, the teaching of music in primary and secondary schools
        has now attained virtually worldwide acceptance.
